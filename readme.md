# Scripter's Haven - IntenseLogic Tech Demo and Sandbox Game

Scripter's haven is a sandbox game primarily focused on building and scripting in Regions, which are where servers connect to each other in a peer-to-peer fashion and agree to each share a chunk of a huge in-game world.

# Running

Requires a build of IntenseLogic. If you have a build of it installed elsewhere, you can run it with:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH="path/to/IntenseLogic/libs" path/to/il/binary -r main.lua
